## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a (on a way to be a) full stack developer, and aspiring to be one. I was graduated from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya in 2018, and majoring in Information System specialized in Decision Support System.

Right now i am working fulltime as a Loan Administration Staff in a Bank. I realized my interest in Technology especially in Computer Science isn't fading, and believe many opportunities still available in this industry, that's why i tighten my belt and joined RevoU as one of the Full Stack Software Engineering Student.
